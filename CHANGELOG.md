- Prime cache before attempting to validate on multiple threads

## [0.9.5] - 2025-08-28

### Fixed

- Backwards compatibility for 3.8, etc


## [0.9.4] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- New validate command to validate yaml against json schema. Previously you had to compile to validate.

### Changed
- New dependency on orjson, urllib3 for speed. Tomli for backwards compatibility.

## [0.9.3] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- Detect drift failed on arg parse. Validated with more comprehensive basic_check.sh test.

## [0.9.2] - 2025-08-23

### Fixed

- Bash style error handling in CLI code with sys.exit + numeric error code, python exceptions everywhere else.
- Better error reporting when running gui/tui/interactive without installing `[all]`

## [0.9.1] - 2025-08-22

### Fixed

- Core mode less likely to fail in import errors. Install help is now vertically more compact.
- `doctor` command should be fixed now.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-08-22

### Changed

- Installation is `xkcd_random` for core in the CI/build server or `xkcd_random[all]` for all commands on your laptop.
  this will mitigate against supply chain risks as the core has very, very few 3rd party packages.

### Added

- CLI option for `xkcd_random run --in-file .gitlab-ci.yml` for best efforts to run a pipeline locally. This is not a
  real runner!

## [0.8.22] - 2025-08-21

### Changed

- Map deploy writes to multiple folders.
- Map commit gathers multiple folders. Does not handle conflicts yet.

### Added

- Best effort local runner will attempt to run a `.gitlab-ci.yml`, obviously without many, many feature.

## [0.8.21] - 2025-08-20

### Added

- `# Pragma: do-not-validate-schema` for `!reference` code. Gitlab merges all templates before json validation.

## [0.8.20] - 2025-08-20

### Fixed

- Fixed regression where stages were turned into string blocks.

### Added

- Now validates yaml against Gitlab's Json Schema. No flag to ignore validation results.

## [0.8.19] - 2025-08-19

### Fixed

- Fixed regression where scripts were quoted lists again. Added a lot of unit tests.

### Added

- Compile will skip if no changes have been made since last compile to any file in the input folder.

## [0.8.18] - 2025-08-19

### Fixed

- Fix for variable lists turning into a string block/`!reference` turning into a plain list.

## [0.8.17] - 2025-08-17

### Fixed

- Graph failed to retry other renderers
- Graph failed on utf-8 error
- Color logging not useful in GUI/TUI Popen calls
- Lint didn't get gitlab_url from config
- Fix `Pragma` feature
- Fix tkinter to change tab when command run

## [0.8.16] - 2025-08-17

### Changed

- Documentation, docstrings, help text
- Init now covers all the config option.

## [0.8.15] - 2025-08-16

### Added

- Interactive mode via xkcd_random-interactive command
- GUI via xkcd_random-gui command

### Changed

- `shred` renamed to decompile.
- Config updates to support storing almost all command options in config file
- Inline supports Pragma commands to skip certain bash from being in-lined.
    - `# Pragma: do-not-inline`: Prevents inlining on the current line.
    - `# Pragma: do-not-inline-next-line`: Prevents inlining on the next line.
    - `# Pragma: start-do-not-inline`: Starts a block where no inlining occurs.
    - `# Pragma: end-do-not-inline`: Ends the block.
    - `# Pragma: allow-outside-root`: Bypasses the directory traversal security check.

## [0.8.14] - 2025-08-16

### Added

- Basc textual TUI added to mirror the CLI interface
- Generates makefile for decompile command

## [0.8.13] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed

## [0.8.12] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- Graph command
- Doctor command for diagnostics

### Fixed

- decompile write to a folder now.
- decompile will take --in-file or --in-folder
- decompile records `!reference [.job, key]` as bash comment
- decompile now logs with relative path.
- decompile should now use path relative to yaml not cwd
- Leading `.` got stripped from file names. Fixed

## [0.8.11] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- Install/uninstall git precommit hooks to compile before commit (not integrated with the popular pre-commit tool).
  Support for
  integration with the `pre-commit` tool is on the way.
- Pluggy support for plugins

### Changed

- Now support inlining a much larger list of script languages using variations on `interpreter -c "..."`

## [0.8.10] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed

- Minimize all "script as yaml lists" because they are not compatible with line continuation characters. No one should
  use any version of xkcd_random before 0.8.10.

## [0.8.9] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed

- Lost all new lines.

## [0.8.8] - 2025-08-11

### Added

- Support for inlining other languages, python, etc. using `python -c`, etc.

### Fixed

- Force new line at the end of any script.
- Minimize bash written in `- code` lists because of risk of quoting problems.
- Quote strings more aggressively

## [0.8.7] - 2025-08-10

### Changed

- File invocations followed by comment are now detected.
- Concept of script folder and template folder gone. Input folder and output folder is enough.

### Removed

- Global variable file feature is broken, will need to rethink

### Added

- Clean command that only removes unmodified files from output folder
- Checks for stray files in output folder before compiling
- Lint command, but it is in "beta" testing

### Fixed

- No longer rewrites files even when there are no changes

## [0.8.6] - 2025-08-09

### Changed

- Map deploy and map commit now restricted to .sh, .ps1 and .y\[a\]ml files.

### Added

- Map commit CLI available.
- Suggestions on incorrect cli command

## [0.8.5] - 2025-08-08

### Changed

- Discourage excessive quotes

### Fixed

- Gracefully degrade if someone changes generated yaml to invalid yaml.

### Added

- Map deploy started.

## [0.8.4] - 2025-08-06

### Added

- Shows command used to generate in the header
- Added "detect-drift" command, to complement the existing drift detection that runs at compile time.

### Fixed

- Bug that stringified certain complex values in yaml maps.

## [0.8.3] - 2025-08-05

### Added

- Basic ps1 file support

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with copy2local

## [0.8.2] - 2025-08-05

### Added

- Checks for updated package from pypi.

### Changed

- copy2local now copies the contents of src folder to destination folder, to reduce nesting.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-08-05

### Added

- Improve logging

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-04

### Added

- Inlines bash by same logic as inlining bash into yaml. Looks for `source script.sh` and inlines it.

### Changed

- clone2local is now copy2local using archive and copy commands to get a part of your remote repo into a dependent
  report for testing.

### Fixed

- Reference or multiple scripts in a script list would all be stomped by last script.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-08-02

### Added

- Started work on a clone feature to get scripts into dependent repos for testing. Not fully baked yet.

### Removed

- A `--format` option was a bad idea because all of the major yaml formatting tools are in various states of
  unsupportedness and cause failures unrelated to xkcd_random's outputs. Use your favorite orchestration tool, such as
  make or just to format with a yaml formatter that works for you.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-07-30

### Changed

- Hash is now a bash64 encode of whole yaml document so reformats with more than just whitespace changes can be detected
  correctly

### Fixed

- Loosely detect anchors (assumes all hashes with a list value and ./script.sh pattern are script anchors)
- Detects jobs with only before_script or after_script

## [0.5.1] - 2025-07-30

### Fixed

- Preserve long lines
- Remove leading blank lines from scripts to avoid indentation indicators (e.g. `|2-`)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed

- Subfolders with yaml files are now processed

### Added

- Started a feature to detect modification, currently warns and doesn't stop.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-07-27

### Added

- Watch mode (--watch) to recompile on file changes
- decompile supports job-level variables
- decompile automatically includes if-block to include job level and global variables.
- decompile generates mock CI variables file
- init command to generate config file

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added

- Option to use toml config file or envvar config instead of CLI switches

### Fixed

- Python 3.14 support fixed.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added

- decompile command to turn pre-existing bash-in-yaml pipeline templates into shell files and yaml

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-26

### Added

- compile command exists
- verbose and quiet logging
- CLI interface
- supports simple in/out project structure
- supports corralling scripts and templates into a scripts or templates folder, which confuses path resolution
